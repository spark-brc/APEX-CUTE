The Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender - auto-Calibration and UncerTainty Estimator (APEX-CUTE) was developed to facilitate the calibration and uncertainty analysis routines with a user-friendly interface [(Wang et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.13031/trans.57.10601). APEX-CUTE was developed by the framework of the Integrated Parameter and Uncertainty Analysis Tool [(IPEAT, Yen et al. (2014))](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.01.004) with theprimary coding platform in Python. The current revision includes Sensitivity Analysis (SA) and the Dynamically Dimensioned Search (DDS) algorithm [(Tolson and Shoemaker, 2007)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005WR004723) for APEX auto-calibration. For the DDS optimization procedure, APEX-CUTE interacts with APEX by modifying APEX input files with candidate solution, running APEX, evaluating model output by calculating performance statistics, perturbing current best solution to generate candidate solution, and iteratively repeating the process until maximum number of objective function evaluations completed. APEX-CUTE offers sensitivity analysis using the Morris method ([Morris, 1991](https://doi.org/10.2307/1269043); [Campolongo et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2006.10.004)). These SA and auto-calibration tools can be used to complement usersâ€™ refinement of an APEX model. Users are responsible for conducting necessary checks for model input and initial runs before conducting SA and/or auto-calibration using APEX-CUTE to make sure that the basic APEX input and setup are correct. More applications of APEX-CUTE can also be found in [Wang et al. (2015)](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/%28ASCE%29HE.1943-5584.0001119).
